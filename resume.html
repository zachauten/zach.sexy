      <span>Software Engineer - <a href="https://www.fidelitycharitable.org">Fidelity Charitable</a></span>
      <span>March 2018 - March 2021</span>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Wrote a part of the customer facing site that would let customers contribute assets from non-fidelity accounts (nodejs, angular). A part of this also involved writing a web-service (java, spring) to serve pdf's.</li>
      <li>Wrote a web-service that allowed customers to automatically transfer certain assets from brokerage to charitable accounts. These transfers used to require manual intervention.</li>
      <li>Updated parts of a legacy customer service application (struts, java) to run on a more modern web framework (angular 8 w/ ngrx). This also involved writing new micro-services.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug where some grants to charities were categorized incorrectly, and wrote a SQL script that amended existing records.</li>
      <li>Wrote a python script to replace login credentials in hundreds of tests after the test database had been refreshed.</li>
      <li>Wrote test automation, mostly for the browser (java, selenium, javascript, protractor). Also wrote tests for rest api’s.</li>
      <li>Worked on "Innovation Day" hackathons. For one I implemented a tool that provided our front end with realistic data in test environments, and for another I worked with a designer to create a proof of concept for a front end component.</li>
      <li>Was on the architecture group where I spent part of my time writing documentation and making proof of concepts for things that the architecture team wants to see used in the wider organization. For example I configured a code analysis tool (sonar) to work with nodejs jenkins pipelines.</li>
